Batch Scheduling:
1.All react states are async code.
2.Async code will not depend on another state.
3.If you need state to be updated after another state update please use useEffects()
4.If any state changes happens entire functional component will re-render.
5.Multiple states in one single function will re-render only one time from react 17 onwards because of batch scheduling architecture.
6.Batch scheduling is already written by react developers. During compilation it will take care automatically.
